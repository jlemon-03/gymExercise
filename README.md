A package containing gym member exercise data and functions to aid in determing exercise routines. 
------------------------------------------

Data can be loaded by typing data(data), and can similarly be summarised and quickly viewed with functions like head() to get an idea of what you're working with.

Examples of all functions running are include in functionExamples.

If you wish to test the functions yourself, a safe and easy way to do so is running them in the gymExercise_Intro vignette, where they are currently arranged with their default parameters, which can be adjusted however you like.
